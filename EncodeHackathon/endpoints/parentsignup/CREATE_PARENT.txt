# Create Parent

## Request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/parents/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "parent_email": "sarah@example.com",
    "auth0_id": "auth0|abc123def456"
  }'
```

## Response:
```json
{
  "parent_id": 456,
  "parent_email": "sarah@example.com", 
  "auth0_id": "auth0|abc123def456",
  "message": "Parent account created successfully"
}
```

## Required Fields:
- `parent_email` - Parent's email address (must be valid email format)
- `auth0_id` - Auth0 user ID (from client-side Auth0 signup/login)

## Validation Rules:
- Email must be valid format
- Email must be unique across all parents
- Auth0 ID must start with "auth0|"
- Auth0 ID must be unique across all parents

## Auto-calculated:
- `parent_id` - Auto-generated primary key
- `created_at` - Current timestamp
- `stripe_customer_id` - Set to NULL (will be filled later when setting up payments)

## Error Messages:

**400 Bad Request:**
- `"Invalid request format"` - Missing required fields or invalid JSON
- `"Invalid auth0_id format. Should start with 'auth0|'"` - Malformed Auth0 ID

**409 Conflict:**
- `"A parent with this Auth0 ID already exists"` - Auth0 ID already registered
- `"A parent with this email already exists"` - Email already in use

**500 Internal Server Error:**
- `"Failed to create parent account"` - Database insert operation failed

## Usage Notes:
- This endpoint is called after successful Auth0 signup/login
- Frontend extracts auth0_id from JWT token and calls this endpoint
- Parent can later set up Stripe payments via separate endpoint
- One Auth0 account = One parent account (enforced by unique constraint)
